# Use Client-to-Site VPN to securely access your IBM Cloud resources

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) come with an additional layer of security as your workload can be completely hidden from the public Internet. But there are times when you will want to get into this private network. A common practice is to use a bastion host to jump into your VPC from your local machine as example. Another option is to use a Client-to-Site VPN software inside your VPC to extend the secure VPC network to your local network.

This repo shows how to configure and provision [Client VPN for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-overview).
